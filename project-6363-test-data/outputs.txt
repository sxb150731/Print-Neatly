Marcel Proust,  in  "Search  of Lost  Time":  We believe  that  we can  change
the things around  us in accordance  with  our desiresâ€”we  believe  it because
otherwise we can  see no favourable  outcome. We  do not think  of the outcome
which generally  comes to pass and  is also favourable:  we do  not succeed in
changing things  in accordance  with our  desires, but  gradually  our desires
change. The  situation  that we hoped  to change  because  it was  intolerable
becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were
absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it,
and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely
see it, so imperceptible has it become.
